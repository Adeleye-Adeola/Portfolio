I’m running for NACOSS Vice President, and I’m asking for your vote—not just for me, but for all of us. I want to make a real difference here, to bring positive change that we can all feel.

Why should you vote for me? My vision is simple: I want to help each of us grow, learn, and succeed. I believe in lifting each other up and creating opportunities, whether it's through events that inspire, resources that help us succeed, or a voice that truly represents everyone. My goal is to make NACOSS stronger and more united, so we all have what we need to reach our full potential.

I won’t say I’m the best, but I can promise I’ll give my best. Every single vote counts, and with your support—and God’s guidance—I’m ready to serve and make a difference. Let’s build a NACOSS we’re all proud to be a part of. Thank you for believing in me.
